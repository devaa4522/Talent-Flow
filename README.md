# TalentFlow — Mini Hiring Platform (Front-end Only)

This is a **React + Bootstrap + MSW** implementation of the assignment brief. It simulates a hiring platform with Jobs, Candidates and Assessments. **All data is persisted locally in IndexedDB via Dexie**, and the app interacts with a fake REST API implemented using MSW handlers that read/write through Dexie.

> Built on 2025-09-20

## Tech stack (simple on purpose)
- React 18 + Vite
- Bootstrap 5 + react-bootstrap (just for convenience components)
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) — REST API
- Dexie — IndexedDB persistence
- dnd-kit — drag & drop (reorder + kanban)
- react-window — virtualization for 1,000+ candidates

## Core flows covered
- **Jobs**
  - Paginated list with filter (title, status) and sort (order, title)
  - Create/Edit in modal (title required, **unique slug** validation handled in API)
  - Archive/Unarchive (edit status)
  - **Reorder via drag-and-drop** with optimistic update and rollback on failure (API sometimes returns 500)
  - Deep link to `/jobs/:jobId`

- **Candidates**
  - **Virtualized list** (1,000 seeded) with client search (name/email) and server-like filter by stage
  - Candidate profile `/candidates/:id` shows **timeline** and supports adding notes with **@mentions** (render-only)
  - **Kanban board** to move candidates across stages (drag-and-drop) with optimistic update + rollback

- **Assessments**
  - Per-job **assessment builder**: sections + questions (single, multi, short, long, numeric, file stub)
  - **Live preview** renders as a fillable form
  - Validation rules (required, numeric range, max length)
  - **Conditional questions**: show if Qx equals value
  - Persist builder and **store submissions** locally

- **Persistence**
  - MSW handlers **read/write through Dexie**.
  - Seed: 25 jobs, 1,000 candidates, 3+ assessments.
  - Latency 200–1200ms; 5–10% error rate on writes; reorder endpoint randomly fails for rollback demo.

## Getting started
```bash
# Node 18+ recommended
npm install

# Generate/update the Service Worker file required by MSW
npm run msw:init

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Project structure
```
src/
  api/             # small API client
  mocks/           # MSW worker + handlers
  pages/           # route-level pages
  utils/           # helpers
  db.js            # Dexie schema
  seed.js          # first-run seeders
  App.jsx, main.jsx
public/
  mockServiceWorker.js  # generated by `npm run msw:init`
```

## Notes / Decisions
- Chose **MSW** (instead of Mirage) to match the brief and keep the "network" layer realistic.
- Handlers use Dexie directly, so refreshing the page restores state from IndexedDB.
- Reorder is **optimistic** on the current page slice; server returns 500 sometimes to demo rollback.
- Assessment file upload is a **stub** (stores the filename only) per the brief.
- The UI uses casual Bootstrap styling to keep things simple and readable.

## Deployment
- Works on Netlify/Vercel as a static app. Remember to run `npm run msw:init` once (the generated SW file must be present in `public/`).


## Scripts
- `npm run msw:init` — generate/refresh MSW service worker in `public/`.
- `npm run dev` — dev server on port 5173.
- `npm run build` — production build.

## Known limitations / Future improvements
- More robust "tags" filtering for jobs (right now typed as comma-separated).
- Candidate notes are stored only client-side in the profile component (timeline API could be extended to persist notes).
- Access control / auth not included (out of scope for front-end-only brief).
- More comprehensive error toasts instead of `alert()`.
